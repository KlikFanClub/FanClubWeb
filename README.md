## General info
***
* This is a collaborative Laravel CRUD project for the Full Stack Development Bootcamp developed by KlikFanClub team.
* Project status: work in progress. It's missing the event views, blog and the entire ecommerce structure. From the beginning we knew that we would not be able to deliver everything.

* Heroku deployment url: https://xyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxyxy.herokuapp.com/

## Concept
***
* What is FanClub?

A physical space dedicated to displaying and commercializing pieces of graphic art both of its own authorship and of artists and designers from different parts of the world.
Mainly from Latin American women and young people who have not yet had the opportunity to enter the European artistic market.
In addition, the Fan Club periodically develops workshops of a creative nature, such as Modeling in Plasticine and Chinese Ink, among others.
Location: Calle de Puigmartí, 37 (Pl John Lennon) - 08012 Barcelona

* What is the purpose of the project?

It was born with the aim of exhibiting, not only through the physical store but also THROUGH THE WEB, its own artistic work and to give space to other artists.
That the store and website become a stimulating community, where art can be available to everyone, at an accessible price and that this positively influences the chosen environment, which in this case is the fascinating Barrio de Gracia in the City of Barcelona.

## Design

First, was made a design with Figma. It is also responsive. For the web application web we used SASS and Laravel's Blade components. On the home page there is a slider with favorite workart done with Bootstrap. With Vue we have worked in the catalog view with the functionalities of filtering an artist or all the products. In addition to configuring the authentication according to the type of user (isAdmin) so that the CRUD buttons appear.
